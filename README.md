# CRC.Treg.LOY


## Summery
We hypothesized that in Colorectal cancer (CRC), Lose of Chromosome Y (LOY) may affect expression level of markers in Tumor Infiltration Lynphocytes (TILs) related with the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment. In this project we indicate that LOY in CRC is associated with increased expression of PDCD1, TIGIT and IKZF2 genes. We  showed that LOY may intensify features related with the suppressive phenotype of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in Tumor Micor-Environment (TME), what may negatively affect treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
